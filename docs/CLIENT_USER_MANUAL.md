# Project-X: End-to-End Platform Setup & Administrator Client Manual

This manual details the step-by-step onboarding, setup, and lead management workflows in Project-X. It is divided into two parts: **SuperAdmin Platform Setup** and **Studio Admin Operations**.

## 1. Complete System Setup Flow

This diagram illustrates the full lifecycle: starting from platform initialization by the SuperAdmin, followed by Studio setup, channel connection, and finally day-to-day CRM lead management.

## 2. PART A: SuperAdmin Platform Setup (Step-by-Step)

The SuperAdmin configures the system-wide credentials and initializes new studio workspaces.

### Step 1: Login to the SuperAdmin Portal
1. Navigate to the login page of Project-X (e.g. `http://3.22.101.52/login`).
2. Enter the SuperAdmin credentials:
   * **Default Email**: `admin@example.com` (or your configured admin email).
3. Click **Sign In** to access the platform overview dashboard.

### Step 2: Configure System Google Credentials
1. Click on the **Settings** gear icon in the lower-left sidebar menu.
2. In the **Credentials Manager** card, click **Select JSON File**.
3. Upload your Google Cloud Service Account JSON key file.
4. Click **Save Credentials**. The system will reload the Google Sheets client instantly without requiring a server reboot.

### Step 3: Create a New Studio Workspace
1. Navigate to the **Studios** page in the sidebar.
2. Click the **Create Studio** button in the top right.
3. Fill in the required fields:
   * **Studio Name**: The user-friendly business name (e.g., `Yoga Bliss Singapore`).
   * **Slug**: The URL slug identifier (e.g., `yoga-bliss-singapore`). This determines the public scheduling and lead capture link.
   * **Timezone**: Set the operating timezone for booking slot scheduling.
4. Click **Create Studio**. The studio is now initialized and ready for its administrators.

## 3. PART B: Studio Admin Integration Setup

Once a studio is created, Studio Administrators configure their specific integration channels.

### Step 1: Connect Google Sheets
1. Log in to Project-X and open the Studio dashboard.
2. Open your target Google Spreadsheet in a separate browser tab.
3. Click the blue **Share** button (top right) and share the sheet with Project-X's service email:
   `studiox-sheets-writer@heroic-artifact-434914-d4.iam.gserviceaccount.com` as an **Editor**.
4. Copy the **Spreadsheet ID** from the browser address bar (the code between `/d/` and `/edit`).
5. In Project-X, go to **Studio Settings** (sidebar) -> scroll to **Google Sheets Sync**.
6. Paste the **Spreadsheet ID**, enter the **Tab Name** (e.g., `Leads`), set the toggle to **Active**, and click **Save**.

### Step 2: Connect Meta WhatsApp API
1. Navigate to **Channels** from the sidebar of your studio workspace.
2. Click **Connect WhatsApp**.
3. Retrieve your credentials from your Meta Developer WhatsApp settings:
   * **WABA ID**: WhatsApp Business Account ID.
   * **Phone Number ID**: WhatsApp Phone Number ID.
   * **Display Phone Number**: The public number formatted (e.g., `+1 555 645 5341`).
   * **Access Token**: Your Meta System User Token (encrypted at rest by our database).
4. Paste these details into the fields and click **Connect**.

## 4. PART C: Lead Management & Pipeline Automation

Day-to-day operations are automated so that staff actions in Project-X instantly sync to Google Sheets.

### Scenario A: Scheduling a Trial Slot
1. When a lead books a slot via your public booking page, or when an admin schedules a slot via the CRM lead profile page:
   * The database automatically sets `trial_purchased = true`.
   * An event is queued in the transactional `outbox`.
   * Within 5 seconds, the Google Sheet is updated: Column N (**Trial Purchased?**) switches to **`Yes`** and Column U (**Status**) updates to **`trial_booked`**.

### Scenario B: Enrolling a Member
1. When a lead decides to sign up, click **Edit Lead** on their CRM profile page.
2. Change their status dropdown to **Member**.
3. Enter their agreed **Monthly Fee** in the input field.
4. Click **Save**.
   * The database automatically flags `member_sold = true` and calculates the average predicted lifetime revenue.
   * The Google Sheet is updated: Column Q (**Member Sold?**) switches to **`Yes`**, Column R receives the **Monthly Fee**, and Column U (**Status**) updates to **`member`**.

## 5. Troubleshooting & FAQ

#### Q: The sync state says "Active", but updates aren't appearing in Google Sheets.
**A**: Ensure that the Google Sheet is shared with `studiox-sheets-writer@heroic-artifact-434914-d4.iam.gserviceaccount.com` as an **Editor**. If it is not shared, Google's API will reject write attempts.

#### Q: How can I check if the background sync worker is running?
**A**: A platform administrator can check container logs on the EC2 host with:
```bash
sudo docker compose logs -f api
```
Look for logs containing `sheets_worker` processing queue items.

## 6. Lead Import Templates

To import existing leads in bulk into Project-X (using the **Import Leads** button on the Leads page), you can upload an Excel (.xlsx) or CSV file. 

The structure of the file should follow the template layout below. It is highly recommended to construct a spreadsheet with two sheets:

### SHEET 1: Field Descriptions & Instructions
This sheet serves as a guide for your staff to understand the validation rules for each column:

| Column Header | Accepted Keys / Variations | Data Type | Required? | Validation Rules & Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **First Name** | `First Name`, `firstName` | Text | **Yes** | The lead's first name. (e.g. `John`) |
| **Last Name** | `Last Name`, `lastName` | Text | **Yes** | The lead's last name. (e.g. `Doe`) |
| **Email** | `Email`, `email address` | Text | **Yes*** | Must be a valid email format. (e.g. `john@example.com`). *Either Email or Phone is required. |
| **Phone** | `Phone`, `phone number`, `contact` | Text/Number | **Yes*** | Digit-based phone format. (e.g. `+15551234567` or `555-123-4567`). *Either Email or Phone is required. |
| **Plan** | `Plan`, `fitness plan` | Text | No | The plan they are interested in. If it contains the word "trial" (e.g. "Trial Pass"), the lead's status is automatically set to `trial_booked`. |
| **Goals** | `Goals`, `goal` | Text | No | Additional comments on fitness goals. |
| **Notes** | `Notes`, `note` | Text | No | Internal follow-up notes. |
| **Status** | `Status`, `lead status` | Text | No | Initial status. Accepted values: `new`, `contacted`, `trial_booked`, `member`, `dropped`. (Defaults to `new`). |

### SHEET 2: Lead Data (The Actual Import Sheet)
This is the sheet where you input the actual data rows. The first row must be the headers exactly as shown below:

| First Name | Last Name | Email | Phone | Plan | Goals | Notes | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Jane | Doe | jane.doe@example.com | +15559876543 | Monthly Membership | Lose weight | Prefers morning classes | new |
| Bob | Smith | bob.smith@example.com | 555-456-7890 | Trial Pass | Build muscle | Referred by Jane | trial_booked |
